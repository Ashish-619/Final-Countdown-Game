# Final-Countdown-Game
Final Countdown is a fun and addictive timing game built with React. Players choose from four difficulty levels—Novice, Medium, Hard, and Expert—and try to stop the timer as close as possible to the target time. The closer you are, the higher your score. It's a test of precision, reflexes, and perfect timing!
